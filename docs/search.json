Analytical Techniques: leveraging nnPCA, article demonstrates multiple mesenchymal phenotype scores can identified correlated EMT scores gene sets. Additional functionalities include: - Loading annotating cell/sample data. - Utilizing existing datasets gene signatures, Panchy_et_al signatures. - Computing gene set scores using bulk RNA-seq example walk-throughs. Visualizations Plot Construction: - Plotting E-M score correlations observe phenotypic variations across cells. - Dimension-specific scatter plots mesenchymal (M) scores, highlighting potential gene divergence cellular heterogeneity. - Creation combined plots comprehensive visualization -score relationships. - Analysis score distributions across cell types using histograms. - Heatmaps gene expression data. Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis: package extends functionality single-cell data, indicating steps importing, EMT scoring, plotting dynamic gene expression changes along pseudotime. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) can used clustering EMT states correlating states biological processes. Pathway Process Integration: assessing pathways associated EMT, article illustrates pathway activity scores can calculated correlated EMT scores identify significant biological pathways. - significant positive negative correlations among pathways visualized using bar charts.
